## Data - Serverless Edition
This is a serverless discord bot that runs on a CloudFlare worker. It isn't extremely feature-rich, but it is pretty fun. It is written primarily in "Python" using [Transcrypt](https://www.transcrypt.org/). It uses Discord slash commands to interract with users.

It has the following commands:
- /aww - Post media from /r/aww's hot list
- /earth - Post media from /r/EarthPorn's hot list
- /invite - Generate an invite link for the bot
- /chat - Talk with the bot using OpenAI
- /reply - Continue a conversation by fetching conversation history from an Updash database
- /image - Generate an image using DALL-E
